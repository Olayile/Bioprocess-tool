# OpenFerm: Bioprocess-tool

A web application for the kinetic modelling and estimation of kinetic parameters

## Expected results
- Simulate bioreactor experiments involving microbial species and predict the
products of the experiments. 

- Study the effects of key process variables, for example, initial substrate
concentration, temperature

- Study both batch and continuous bioprocesses. 


## Pre/post regression diagnostics

- Sensitivity
- Identifiability
- Model significance
